He taught me about guns, how to use them and how to handle them, and about death, what happens and what it means, at the age of 3. He taught me how to pick locks and how to hide my emotions at the age of four. By age five, he was convinced that I would follow in his footsteps. I just wasn't sure that I wanted to..."-->
